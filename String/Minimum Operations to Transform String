3675. Minimum Operations to Transform String

/*
You are given a string s consisting only of lowercase English letters.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):
Choose any character c in the string and replace every occurrence of c with the next lowercase letter in the English alphabet.
Return the minimum number of operations required to transform s into a string consisting of only 'a' characters.
Note: Consider the alphabet as circular, thus 'a' comes after 'z'.
*/


class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        char[] ch = s.toCharArray();

        Arrays.sort(ch);
        int ans=0;
        char lastChar = ch[n-1];
        if(lastChar=='a') return ans;
        
        for(int i=0;i< n-1;i++){
